# EloGGs
This is an old patched 1v1.LOL boosting program I developed months ago, My team made around $1000 total off of this, but now it's been patched by the developers.

It still partially works but there's a huge ratelimit whilst boosting, and is now basically useless.

The program includes stat checking, nickname changing, themes, and boosting ofcourse.

*This is only being posted so people who bought it or were curious about it now know and understand how it worked*

# Usage
Here's how to setup the program
- Create a pastebin paste and put a key in there (doesnt matter what) copy the raw link and put it in **line 59**
- Put your refresh token (get it through the network packet when logging into 1v1.LOL) into the config.json file
- Load the program and enter the key you put in the pastebin

You can now use the program.

# Credits
I **(codeuk/doop)** developed this program, but a few people helped with the previous versions and got me into boosting.
- **Skyla** - Helped with coding other versions
- **Kiwi**  - Helped make original elo booster (ID BOOSTING)
